New and Modified users,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to perform the review",Pass,Avid inspected TT Security Policy and 'Identity Access Management Process and Procedure' documents. The policies state that all access requests must be reviewed by the user's line manager and the IT Manager (or their delegate) before the IT Manager provisions the required access to the relevant application. All access requests and approvals must be evidenced via email. No individual can approve their own access request.
,Determine if there are different processes for different access requests: - Employment Status: employee / agency / contractor / third party etc. - Access Requested: privilege access / DDA / normal business user access etc.,Pass,"All employees, contractors, third party access, etc and all access requests types (e.g. business user access, IT access, etc) will be requested, approved and provisioned in the same way noted above. This is included in the attached policies as a requirement."
,"How the control operator confirms the appropriateness of the approver (e.g., through comparing the approval to a listing of authorized individuals, if available or through evaluation of roles & responsibilities).",Pass,"Avid met with the IT manager and identified a new employee that had recently joined the organisation in the finance department, Alan Smith (Employee ID: 01234). He was granted access to the 'Input journal' profile in the General Ledger application. Avid obtained the 'Alan Smith - New access email trail' evidence (linked) from Joe to inspect evidence to support the provisioning of Alan's new access. The email trail confirms that a new access request was raised by Alan Smith himself on 05/06/2022 asking for access to the Input journal profile in the General Ledger application. Alan's line manager, Briana Lara, was cc'd in the email and subsequently provided her approval on 12/06/2022. Lastly, Joe Bloggs provided his final approval and confirmed that the requested access had been provisioned within the General Ledger application on 19/06/2022. Avid observed on screen the current HR listing of employees and their associated line managers. Avid validated that Briana Lara was Alan Smith's line manager and therefore was the appropriate approver for Alan's access request. The timeline of approvals and provisioning of access confirms that the access request was appropriately approved before access was provisioned by the IT manager. Avid confirmed that the requested access correctly provisioned in the application through inspection of the ACL for the General Ledger application."
,"If there are specific permissions (e.g., privileged access) that require additional approvals in addition to the standard access request.",Pass,"If an individual requests ""Admin"" permission to either in-scope application, this is required to be approved by the Finance Director in addition to the IT manager and line manager due to the ability to bypass segregation of duties. This permission is only granted to individuals in IT who support the applications."
,How the control operator confirms that the request is for a valid employee/contractor.,Pass,"Avid confirmed via inquiry with Joe Bloggs that before provisioning any access, he verifies the validity of the employee and confirms their current line manager via inspection of the employee directory or confirmation with HR."
,How the control operator follows up on differences or exceptions noted during the processing of the access request.,Pass,Avid confirmed via inquiry with Joe Bloggs that access will not be provisioned without evidence of appropriate line manager approval or if there is a lack of clarity in the access being requested. Joe will follow up with the access beneficiary and their line manager if any evidence or information is missing.
,How the control operator confirms that access is commensurate with job responsibilities.,Pass,"Avid confirmed via inquiry with Joe Bloggs that before provisioning any access, he verifies the validity of the employee and confirms their current line manager via inspection of the employee directory or confirmation with HR. Joe relies on the line manager's approval to verify that the access being requested is commensurate with job responsibilities. If access being requested is for a different role than others of a similar role this is queried by Joe via email to the line manager to obtain explanation for the variation in role being granted. This may be due to the line manager or requestor not having sufficient understanding of the permission sets associated with each role."
,How the control operator confirms the access request was accurately granted within the system.,Pass,Avid confirmed via inquiry that Joe Bloggs ensures that he only provisions access which has been requested and approved. Avid confirmed this via inspection of the email trail for Alan Smith and observation on-screen for the role granted to Alan Smith for the General Ledger application.
,The period for which the control has been in operation and the frequency of its operation.,Pass,Avid confirmed via inquiry with Joe that the control has been in place throughout the audit period and the control operates on an ad hoc basis when new individuals join the company or new access for existing employees is required.
,The appropriateness of the person(s) performing the control(s).,Pass,"Avid confirmed that as the IT Manager for the organisation, Joe is an appropriate person to be collating access requests, inspecting approvals and provisioning the required access to the relevant applications."
Termination of Leavers,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to perform the review.",Pass,"Avid inspected 'IT Security Policy' and 'Identity Access Management Process and Procedure' documents. The documents state that all access for leaving individuals (no matter of their employment status, e.g., employee, contractor, third party access, etc) and all access requests types (e.g., business user access, IT access, etc) will be removed in the same way."
,Determine if there are different processes for different access requests: - Employment Status: employee / agency / contractor / third party etc. - Access Requested: privilege access / DDA / normal business user access etc.,Pass,"All employees, contractors, third party access, etc and all access requests types (e.g., business user access, IT access, etc) will be requested, approved and provisioned in the same way noted above. This is included in the attached policies as a requirement."
,"How the control operator removes access for terminated employees/contractors, considering: - The notification mechanism to notify the control operator to remove access; - The consideration of the inventory of a user’s access during the removal process; - The access removal process for each tier of relevant access (application, operating system, database, and/or network); and - The required removal timeframes per the relevant policies and/or procedures.",Pass,"The HR Manager (or their delegate) extracts a list of all future leavers and those individuals who have left within the last month & their leave dates from the Payroll & HR application, and sends this via email to the IT Manager (or their delegate) on a weekly basis. The HR Manager includes both the list and query used to extract the list in the email. The IT Manager (or their delegate) will use this list to manually scan, identify and remove all access to applications, network and infrastructure. The IT Manager (or their delegate) will typically perform this task the working day after the leave date of each leaver (per the policy). They have 5 working days to complete this task to allow for capacity constraints, sick leave or holiday, as confirmed via inquiry that if he is out of office for a week or more, he will delegate this task to an appropriate individual with the required level of access. After all relevant access has been removed for each week’s leavers, Joe (or his delegate) will reply back to the weekly email received by the HR Manager (and the CIO) confirming that all actions to remove leavers access has been processed.

Avid inspected this week’s ‘Leavers list’ extracted by the HR Manager for the week commencing XX/XX/2022 and received by Joe via email on the Monday. Avid observed Joe validating the appropriateness of the query used to extract the list and opening this list on the Tuesday, noting one leaver (Andy Paul - Sales Executive) in the week who was due to leave that Monday, the day of the email. Therefore, Avid observed Joe manually scan, identify and remove all access with Andy had to applications, network and infrastructure. Once complete, given that this was the only leaver in the week, Avid observed and inspected Joe’s email back to the HR Manager with the CIO in CC confirming that all access for this week’s leavers had been removed. Avid noted that all actions for this week’s leavers had been appropriately removed in a timely manner by an appropriate individual.
The IT manager removes access to the network as the primary control. The IT manager then inspects applications which are not subject to single sign on to remove access to those. This includes the two applications in scope.
The process is homogenous for each tier.
Disabled/deleted within 5 working days of the leave date or last working day whichever is earlier.
Confirmation from the HR manager to IT manager and CIO that removal has occurred."
,"How management verifies that access was appropriately removed from the system in a timely manner, in accordance with the relevant policies and/or procedures.",Pass,Confirmation from the HR manager to IT manager and CIO that removal has occurred.
,The period for which the control has been in operation and the frequency of its operation.,Pass,Avid confirmed via inquiry with Joe that the control has been in place throughout the audit period and the control operates on an ad hoc basis when individuals leave the company.
,The appropriateness of the person(s) performing the control(s).,Pass,"Avid confirmed that as the IT Manager for the organisation, Joe (or their delegate) is an appropriate person to be collating leaver information and deprovisioning all application, network and infrastructure access in a timely manner."
Privilege access management,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to define privileged access and relevant monitoring.",Pass,"Inspected the entity’s 'Identity Access Management Process and Procedure,' dated xx/xx/2022 which included management's definition of privileged system access. The entity defines privileged access as any account which have permissions/roles which provide the ability to: - perform oversight/risk configuration within applications - perform any activities above 'read only' on databases and/or operating systems - amend access rights of other accounts (for example granting/revoking access)"
,"Which privileged (powerful) (e.g., super-user, System or Security Administrator, SUDO, Root, DBA, etc.) IDs (including generic), system transactions or activities are relevant to the engagement.",Pass,"Avid observed the IT Security Manager navigate to the user management screens and noted the following: Revenue Application: - there was one 'admin' account which is provided as default with the application. This is the only account that can amend configurations in the application. - there were two IT Helpdesk accounts which were used by the IT Helpdesk team (managed by Joe and new users when they join the team), to manage configuration and to support if any IT incidents happen - all other accounts belonged to finance team users and had non-privileged access per definition in policy. General Ledger Application: - there was one named IT 'admin' account which was used by the IT manager for managing access and supporting in case of incidents (updating settings and parameters). - all other accounts belonged to finance team users and had non-privileged access per definition in policy. Database: For the two SQL databases that support Revenue Application, General Ledger Application we noted that there were: - 3x Database Administrator (DBA) accounts which were used to manage/administer the database. These accounts had administrative permissions - A number of service/generic accounts which are used by the system to process automated transactions. We confirmed through inspection of system settings that these are non-interactive accounts. - The remaining accounts were read-only (for example the Auditor account) and therefore not defined as privileged. Operating system: The following accounts/groups were noted as being privileged: - Windows AD groups - default Domain Administrators (DA) group, default Enterprise Administrators (EA) group, default built-in (BA) administrators group - Other Windows AD groups were noted as being for normal business users, therefore not defined as privileged."
,How are generic or interactive system privileged accounts attributed to human owners.,Pass,"Via the IT Security Manager. Determined that system/service accounts are owned by the associated system owner. For example, system/service accounts that exist on the databases and operating systems supporting Revenue Application are assigned to the Revenue Application system owner."
,Who is responsible for defining and identifying powerful IDs or sensitive transactions or activities.,Pass,"If an individual requests 'Admin' permission to either in-scope application, this is required to be approved by the Finance Director in addition to the IT manager and line manager due to the ability to bypass segregation of duties. This permission is only granted to individuals in IT who support the applications."
,Document an understanding of the account creation process and key controls. Consider using the procedures in tab - APD - Starter Process or identify which procedures are homogenous and any additional steps for privileged access (for example both line manager and application owner in addition to line manager).,Pass,"All access (including privileged access) is subject to the access provisioning/transfer control as outlined on the ""APD - Starter Process"" tab, however, an additional requirement is in place for privileged access. If an individual requests ""Admin"" permission to either in-scope application, this is required to be approved by the Finance Director in addition to the IT manager and line manager due to the ability to bypass segregation of duties. This permission is only granted to individuals in IT who support the applications."
,"Which privileged (powerful) (e.g., super-user, System or Security Administrator, SUDO, Root, DBA, etc.) IDs (including generic), system transactions or activities are relevant to the engagement.",Pass,Accounts related to the related infrastructure (database or server) require review and approval from both the line manager (standard for all access requests) plus review and approval from the system owner prior to being provisioned. Approval is provided via email and evidenced for audit purposes. Avid validated the ticket for privileged access (Database administrator access) for the SQL database supporting Revenue Application and noted that approval was provided by: - Finance Director - Revenue Application system owner
,"Monitoring Activities: How management monitors powerful transaction/activities, including generic IDs with access to those functions.",Pass,"On a weekly basis, the IT Security Manager reviews two automated reports which show activity performed on operating systems and databases, including: - login activity for databases - membership of privileged Active Directory groups"
,"How management performs the review of powerful transactions/activities, including generic IDs with access to those functions, based on the nature of the information (for example system alerts or activities report or log).",Pass,"The IT Security Manager reviews both reports to confirm that activity is restricted only to appropriate members of IT (for databases the DBA team, for operating systems the IT Support and Networking team), and check for indicators of suspicious activity (for example login activity at non-working hours, accessing from non-work laptops). We confirmed via inquiry that no suspicious/inappropriate activity had been noted during the audit period to date."
,"How management verifies completeness and accuracy of the information being monitored (e.g., agreeing monitoring configuration settings to those transactions or activities identified for monitoring).",Pass,The IT Security Manager has reviewed the report he adds an extra column with his conclusion and electronically signs to demonstrate the control was performed.
,"How management identifies exceptions to the usage of powerful user IDs, transactions or activities.",Pass,All exceptions identified for monitoring are logged.
,How the control operator executes an investigation or use of access and resolution of exceptions on a timely basis in accordance with the relevant policies and/or procedures.,Pass,Exceptions are reviewed for investigation by the IT Security Manager.
