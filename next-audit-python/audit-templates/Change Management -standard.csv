Change Request and Approval,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to perform testing, review and authorization of changes and/or emergency changes.",Management should have a policy or procedure that addresses change management,"Per inquiry with James Milner, we noted that management have developed a change management policy titled 'Change Management and Release Procedure'. This policy covers requirement for testing, approval and emergency changes. ",Inspect / Observe relevant policy and procedure documents and document name and version inspected.,"1. Policies should be approved. 
2. Policies should be approved or reviewed in within 2 years of the audit period. Consider the policy outdated if it has not been reviewed in 2 years. ","We inspected a copy of the change management and release procedure noting the following
1. It was approved by Chris Thomas, the Head of IT
2. It was version 4
3. It was approved on 20/04/2022

This is considered appropriate as the policy was updated and reviewed in the current year. "
,"How and who is responsible for making changes to application code (e.g. versions) configuration (e.g., settings or tolerances that can be made via the application without requiring amendments to code) and whether such changes are subject to the same change control processes.",,"Both applications have been developed by third party vendors. As such version changes are made by the third party development companies and version upgrades are released every 6 months by the vendors, with patches released occasionally. Management run both applications 2 versions behing. These changes are logged by management and tested and approved prior to release following the standard change process. 

Configuration changes are made by the application owner in IT based on a request from the business. These follow the same standard change process. 

The CAB is required to approve changes and typically UAT is performed by the requestor for the change or their delegate","Inspect system configuration and/or user access to determine management has appropriately segregated access to development, test and production or has other controls in place to achieve the same objective","1. The environment for development, test, and production should be segregated.","Confirmed through validating applications are third party developed and procedures performed over Privileged access to confirm accounts that can make changes to settings.

We inspected the application and confirmed the environment are segregated using URLs. 
1. Production: app.com
2. Test : app.test.com
3. Development : app.dev.com

,"How emergency change criteria has been defined and requirements around the timing of required testing and promotion approvals (e.g., within 48 hours of a change being promoted into production).","1. There should be a clear definition of requirement for emergency 
2. Emergency changes should be subject to test and approval","The 'Change enablement policy' and ' change management standard operating procedures' set out criteria for an emergency change. A change is considered an emergency if it is proposed to address an issue with system functionalyt which would otherwise prevent the operation of a core business process. Verbal approval must be sought from CAB or the CIO prior to deployment testing and approval of these changes is still required, with the policy dictating that all change documentation should be in place within 72 hours of the change being implemented in production. This includes testing, approval from process owners and retrospective approval from the CAB (which includes the CIO) via email. ",For one emergency change inspect the criteria in the policy and compare to an emergency change logged in the period to understand how the criteria are defined and met.,"1. There should be a clear definition of requirement for emergency 
2. Emergency changes should be subject to test and approval","We inspected a copy of change ticket XYZ456 for an emergency change raised by the financial controller.

It was confirmed that the change met the criteria of an emergency change with issues on reporting functionality.  This was confirmed by the application manager with verbal approval sought from the CIO.

Within the change ticket, the junior developer was assigned to develop the change which was implemented by the application manager on XX/XX/2022.

After the change was implemented, testing was retrospectively completed to confirm that there were no issues with functionality, with results documented and attached to the change ticket.

Approval was retrospectively provided by the process owner on XX/XX/2022.  In addition, the CAB convened to review change documentation and approved this emergency change on XX/XX/2022, 48 hours after implementation. This was logged in the attached change ticket."
Test Management,"How the control operator determines the appropriate level of testing required (e.g., unit, integration, regression and user acceptance testing) was performed. The nature and extent of testing may vary based on the scope and complexity of the change.",1. The policy or procedure document should have a method for determining the level of testing,"The level of testing required is based on the nature of the change, the specific code/configuration subject to change and expected functionality. There is also consideration of any dependencies and wider implications of the change.

Based on this, an itemised test plan is developed. ",For one change inspect / observe the relevant evidence retained.,"1. A test plan should be developed
2. Test should be performed before the change is implemented","For the change sampled under ticket ABC123, we inspected evidence of the test plan documented and attached within the change ticket.

The test plan was tailored to the change, with specific elements of functionality and data points identified for testing.

Testing was completed with results documented in the test plan.  UAT was signed off by the tester within the AR team, with explanations of their procedures and the results documented.

No issues were identified in testing."
,"The process in place to ensure that all required approvers (e.g., representatives from IT and the business) have approved testing cases, scripts and/or plans. The timing of approval and the population of approvers may vary based on the scope, nature and complexity of the system change. The approval process should consider whether the proposed change could impact ICFR and be subjected to appropriate approval where applicable.","1. Change should be approved before deployment
2. Change should be tested before deployment","Approvals are logged within change tickets, with individuals logging their approval and activities through a workflow.

Change tickets and the approvals are subject to review as part of the approval from the CAB to deploy a change.  This acts as a final approval which is also logged in the ticket.","For one change inspect the existence of appropriate supporting evidence of testing, review and approval (e.g., a signature or initials on the document, written explanations, checkmarks, or other indications of follow up etc.)
 and the appropriateness of the approver of each change (e.g., through comparing the approval to a listing of authorized individuals, if available or through evaluation of roles & responsibilities),","1. Change should be approved before deployment
2. Change should be tested before deployment","For the change sampled under ticket ABC123, we confirmed through inspection of the ticket that the following approvals were in place:

1. Approval to develop the change provided by CAB on 30th June
2. UAT completed and approved by the AR manager on 13th July
3. Approval of testing and sign off to deploy the change from the process owner on 15th July
4. Final approval to deploy the change provided by the CAB on 16th July
5. Change implemented in production environment on 17th July"
Segregation of duties,"The process in place to ensure that changes are promoted to production by a person other than the developer, or if applicable, access control mechanisms in place (e.g., use of firefighter/elevated accounts) to allow developers temporary access to production in the event of an emergency.","1. The environments should be segregated
2. The developer of a change should be different from the implementer of the change","With a small application support team, it is not possbible to fully segregate access to development, test and production. The development engineerrs do not have access to admin accounts in the production application environment. 

The change enablement policy sets out protocols to be applied ensuring that the individual responsible from development is different from the people responsible for testing the change, approving and implementing in production. ",Inspect / Observe specific permissions that grant this permission and the users granted this permission. Compare to a relevant organisation chart or other to validate appropriateness. If performed by a service organisation / third party understand how this is segregated and if covered by relevant reporting or monitoring with the third party.,The developer of a change should be different from the implementer of the change,There is natural segregation of duties for third party developed changes as these are promoted by management not the developer. For configuration changes these are made by IT who are distinct from the testing team and also the business owner who performs testing. The CAB approve all changes made.
,The approval for promotion in accordance with agreed upon policies and/or procedures.,"1. Change should be approved before deployment
2. Change should be tested before deployment
3. The developer of a change should be different from the implementer of the change","The level of approval requirement needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy. 

 - Approval to initiate the development process is provided by the change advisory board
- All changes require approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign offf from the change advisorry board.",For one change inspect the approval for promotion in accordance with agreed upon policies and/or procedures.,"1. Change should be approved before deployment
2. Change should be tested before deployment
3. The developer of a change should be different from the implementer of the change","For the change sampled under ticket ABC123, we noted that the change was developed by the development engineer, and was approved by the AR manager and CAB before being implemented by the application manager."
