This policy was approved by their CIO, Sean John, in December 2021.\n\nThe policy outlines the entire process for initiating, testing, and approving changes to their IT systems. All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through their ServiceNow platform. The policy also defines different types of changes, including standard changes, normal changes, emergency changes, application code changes, and configuration changes.\n\nFor emergency changes, which are defined as changes necessary to resolve critical issues that cannot wait for normal processing, verbal approval from the Change Advisory Board (CAB) or CIO is required before deployment. However, formal approval and documentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\n\nThe policy also outlines the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the change management process, including the Change Requester, Change Manager, CAB, Implementer, and Tester. The CAB, consisting of senior IT members, is responsible for enforcing the change management controls.\n\nRisk assessments are an integral part of their change request process. All changes are logged in ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the depth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\n\nTest cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business users. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are meticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the production environment.\n\nThe required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in their Change Management Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the changes before they are implemented. The version that is to be promoted is compared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\n\nThese controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management Policy was approved. The audit was performed by Emma, a PwC auditor, for the Audit Year End of May 2024.",
                "design_details_from_example": "Based on our inquiry with John, the IT Manager at Fountain Plc, and our review of the company's Change Management Policy, we noted that the company has a comprehensive policy in place that addresses change management. This policy, approved by the CIO in December 2021, outlines the procedures for initiating, testing, reviewing, and authorizing changes, including emergency changes, to the company's IT systems.\n\nThe policy categorizes changes into four types: Standard, Normal, Emergency, and Application Code Changes. Each type of change has a defined process that includes initiation, assessment, approval, implementation, testing, and review. The Change Advisory Board (CAB) or designated approvers are responsible for approving changes. All changes, regardless of their type, are managed through the ServiceNow platform, ensuring consistency in the change management procedures.\n\nEmergency changes, defined as changes necessary to resolve critical issues that cannot wait for normal processing, have specific criteria and requirements. These changes must be tested and approved within 48 hours of promotion to production. The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria were met.\n\nThe policy also outlines the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the change management process, including the Change Requester, Change Manager, CAB, Implementer, and Tester. It also provides guidelines for risk and impact assessment, testing requirements, documentation, segregation of duties, communication, and training.\n\nIn conclusion, Fountain Plc has a robust change management policy in place that addresses the requirements for testing, review, and authorization of changes, including emergency changes. This policy has been in place since December 2021 and is enforced by the CAB, which consists of senior IT members.",

These\nprocedures outline the entire process for initiating, testing, and approving changes to our IT\nsystems.\nEmma: Who is responsible for making changes to application code or configurations, and how are\nthese changes managed?\nJohn: Changes to application code are handled by our in-house development team. Configuration\nchanges are typically managed by our system administrators. Both types of changes must go\nthrough our standard change management process, which includes logging the change in\nServiceNow, conducting tests, and obtaining approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).\nEmma: How do you define the criteria for emergency changes, and what are the requirements fortesting and approvals in these cases?\nJohn: An emergency change is defined as a change required to prevent or mitigate a critical issue\nthat could disrupt core business operations. For these changes, verbal approval from the CAB or\nCIO is required before deployment. Although the change is implemented immediately, we conduct\ntesting and document the change as soon as possible afterward. Formal approval and\ndocumentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\nEmma: How do you determine if a change qualifies as an emergency change?\nJohn: The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria\nwere met. Whenever possible, we seek written approval after the deployment.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all changes follow a consistent process, regardless of the type?\nJohn: All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through our\nServiceNow platform. We apply the same process across all in-scope applications to ensure\nconsistency in our change management procedures.\nEmma: How do you handle changes to different types of applications, such as hosted applications,\nSaaS solutions, or internally developed systems?\nJohn: Regardless of the application type, whether hosted, SaaS, or internally developed, all\nchanges are categorized as either standard or emergency. They all follow the same change\nmanagement process as outlined in our policy.\nEmma: How do you assess and manage the risks associated with different types of changes?John: Risk assessments are an integral part of our change request process. All changes are logged\nin ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the\ndepth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\nEmma: How do you create and validate test cases, scripts, and plans to ensure proper testing?\nJohn: Test cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business\nusers. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are\nmeticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the\nproduction environment.\nEmma: How do you confirm that the appropriate individuals are approving the changes?\nJohn: The required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in our Change\nManagement Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the\nchanges before they are implemented.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all relevant stakeholders have approved the testing cases, scripts,\nand plans?\nJohn: Approvals are tracked and logged within the change tickets in ServiceNow. Each stakeholder\nrecords their approval as part of the workflow, and these are reviewed by the CAB before the\nchange is finalized.\nEmma: How do you document and approve the results of testing procedures?John: The results of all testing procedures are documented in ServiceNow. Any issues that arise\nduring testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given.\nEmma: How do you ensure that the version promoted to production is the one that was approved?\nJohn: We utilize version control software to track changes. The version that is to be promoted is\ncompared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\nEmma: How do you maintain segregated access to development, testing, and production\nenvironments?\nJohn: We ensure segregation by assigning different roles for development, testing, and deployment.\nDevelopers do not have access to the production environment. Our Change Management Policy\nmandates that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer who made the\nchange.\nEmma: How do you handle the approval for promoting changes to production?\nJohn: The required approval levels are defined in our Change Management Policy. The CAB\ninitiates the approval process, and both the process owner and the CAB must sign off before a\nchange is promoted to production.\nEmma: How long have these controls been in place?\nJohn: These controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management\nPolicy was approved.Emma: Who is responsible for enforcing these controls, and do they have the appropriate authority?\nJohn: The CAB, which consists of senior IT members, is responsible for enforcing the change\nmanagement controls. They are considered well-qualified and appropriate for this role."

These\nprocedures outline the entire process for initiating, testing, and approving changes to our IT\nsystems.\nEmma: Who is responsible for making changes to application code or configurations, and how are\nthese changes managed?\nJohn: Changes to application code are handled by our in-house development team. Configuration\nchanges are typically managed by our system administrators. Both types of changes must go\nthrough our standard change management process, which includes logging the change in\nServiceNow, conducting tests, and obtaining approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).\nEmma: How do you define the criteria for emergency changes, and what are the requirements fortesting and approvals in these cases?\nJohn: An emergency change is defined as a change required to prevent or mitigate a critical issue\nthat could disrupt core business operations. For these changes, verbal approval from the CAB or\nCIO is required before deployment. Although the change is implemented immediately, we conduct\ntesting and document the change as soon as possible afterward. Formal approval and\ndocumentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\nEmma: How do you determine if a change qualifies as an emergency change?\nJohn: The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria\nwere met. Whenever possible, we seek written approval after the deployment.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all changes follow a consistent process, regardless of the type?\nJohn: All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through our\nServiceNow platform. We apply the same process across all in-scope applications to ensure\nconsistency in our change management procedures.\nEmma: How do you handle changes to different types of applications, such as hosted applications,\nSaaS solutions, or internally developed systems?\nJohn: Regardless of the application type, whether hosted, SaaS, or internally developed, all\nchanges are categorized as either standard or emergency. They all follow the same change\nmanagement process as outlined in our policy.\nEmma: How do you assess and manage the risks associated with different types of changes?John: Risk assessments are an integral part of our change request process. All changes are logged\nin ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the\ndepth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\nEmma: How do you create and validate test cases, scripts, and plans to ensure proper testing?\nJohn: Test cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business\nusers. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are\nmeticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the\nproduction environment.\nEmma: How do you confirm that the appropriate individuals are approving the changes?\nJohn: The required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in our Change\nManagement Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the\nchanges before they are implemented.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all relevant stakeholders have approved the testing cases, scripts,\nand plans?\nJohn: Approvals are tracked and logged within the change tickets in ServiceNow. Each stakeholder\nrecords their approval as part of the workflow, and these are reviewed by the CAB before the\nchange is finalized.\nEmma: How do you document and approve the results of testing procedures?John: The results of all testing procedures are documented in ServiceNow. Any issues that arise\nduring testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given.\nEmma: How do you ensure that the version promoted to production is the one that was approved?\nJohn: We utilize version control software to track changes. The version that is to be promoted is\ncompared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\nEmma: How do you maintain segregated access to development, testing, and production\nenvironments?\nJohn: We ensure segregation by assigning different roles for development, testing, and deployment.\nDevelopers do not have access to the production environment. Our Change Management Policy\nmandates that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer who made the\nchange.\nEmma: How do you handle the approval for promoting changes to production?\nJohn: The required approval levels are defined in our Change Management Policy. The CAB\ninitiates the approval process, and both the process owner and the CAB must sign off before a\nchange is promoted to production.\nEmma: How long have these controls been in place?\nJohn: These controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management\nPolicy was approved.Emma: Who is responsible for enforcing these controls, and do they have the appropriate authority?\nJohn: The CAB, which consists of senior IT members, is responsible for enforcing the change\nmanagement controls. They are considered well-qualified and appropriate for this role."

Both types of changes must go\nthrough our standard change management process, which includes logging the change in\nServiceNow, conducting tests, and obtaining approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).\nEmma: How do you define the criteria for emergency changes, and what are the requirements fortesting and approvals in these cases?\nJohn: An emergency change is defined as a change required to prevent or mitigate a critical issue\nthat could disrupt core business operations. For these changes, verbal approval from the CAB or\nCIO is required before deployment. Although the change is implemented immediately, we conduct\ntesting and document the change as soon as possible afterward. Formal approval and\ndocumentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\nEmma: How do you determine if a change qualifies as an emergency change?\nJohn: The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria\nwere met. Whenever possible, we seek written approval after the deployment.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all changes follow a consistent process, regardless of the type?\nJohn: All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through our\nServiceNow platform. We apply the same process across all in-scope applications to ensure\nconsistency in our change management procedures.\nEmma: How do you handle changes to different types of applications, such as hosted applications,\nSaaS solutions, or internally developed systems?\nJohn: Regardless of the application type, whether hosted, SaaS, or internally developed, all\nchanges are categorized as either standard or emergency. They all follow the same change\nmanagement process as outlined in our policy.\nEmma: How do you assess and manage the risks associated with different types of changes?John: Risk assessments are an integral part of our change request process. All changes are logged\nin ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the\ndepth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\nEmma: How do you create and validate test cases, scripts, and plans to ensure proper testing?\nJohn: Test cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business\nusers. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are\nmeticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the\nproduction environment.\nEmma: How do you confirm that the appropriate individuals are approving the changes?\nJohn: The required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in our Change\nManagement Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the\nchanges before they are implemented.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all relevant stakeholders have approved the testing cases, scripts,\nand plans?\nJohn: Approvals are tracked and logged within the change tickets in ServiceNow. Each stakeholder\nrecords their approval as part of the workflow, and these are reviewed by the CAB before the\nchange is finalized.\nEmma: How do you document and approve the results of testing procedures?John: The results of all testing procedures are documented in ServiceNow. Any issues that arise\nduring testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given.\nEmma: How do you ensure that the version promoted to production is the one that was approved?\nJohn: We utilize version control software to track changes. The version that is to be promoted is\ncompared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\nEmma: How do you maintain segregated access to development, testing, and production\nenvironments?\nJohn: We ensure segregation by assigning different roles for development, testing, and deployment.\nDevelopers do not have access to the production environment. Our Change Management Policy\nmandates that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer who made the\nchange.\nEmma: How do you handle the approval for promoting changes to production?\nJohn: The required approval levels are defined in our Change Management Policy. The CAB\ninitiates the approval process, and both the process owner and the CAB must sign off before a\nchange is promoted to production.\nEmma: How long have these controls been in place?\nJohn: These controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management\nPolicy was approved.Emma: Who is responsible for enforcing these controls, and do they have the appropriate authority?\nJohn: The CAB, which consists of senior IT members, is responsible for enforcing the change\nmanagement controls.

These\nprocedures outline the entire process for initiating, testing, and approving changes to our IT\nsystems.\nEmma: Who is responsible for making changes to application code or configurations, and how are\nthese changes managed?\nJohn: Changes to application code are handled by our in-house development team. Configuration\nchanges are typically managed by our system administrators. Both types of changes must go\nthrough our standard change management process, which includes logging the change in\nServiceNow, conducting tests, and obtaining approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).\nEmma: How do you define the criteria for emergency changes, and what are the requirements fortesting and approvals in these cases?\nJohn: An emergency change is defined as a change required to prevent or mitigate a critical issue\nthat could disrupt core business operations. For these changes, verbal approval from the CAB or\nCIO is required before deployment. Although the change is implemented immediately, we conduct\ntesting and document the change as soon as possible afterward. Formal approval and\ndocumentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\nEmma: How do you determine if a change qualifies as an emergency change?\nJohn: The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria\nwere met. Whenever possible, we seek written approval after the deployment.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all changes follow a consistent process, regardless of the type?\nJohn: All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through our\nServiceNow platform. We apply the same process across all in-scope applications to ensure\nconsistency in our change management procedures.\nEmma: How do you handle changes to different types of applications, such as hosted applications,\nSaaS solutions, or internally developed systems?\nJohn: Regardless of the application type, whether hosted, SaaS, or internally developed, all\nchanges are categorized as either standard or emergency. They all follow the same change\nmanagement process as outlined in our policy.\nEmma: How do you assess and manage the risks associated with different types of changes?John: Risk assessments are an integral part of our change request process. All changes are logged\nin ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the\ndepth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\nEmma: How do you create and validate test cases, scripts, and plans to ensure proper testing?\nJohn: Test cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business\nusers. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are\nmeticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the\nproduction environment.\nEmma: How do you confirm that the appropriate individuals are approving the changes?\nJohn: The required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in our Change\nManagement Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the\nchanges before they are implemented.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all relevant stakeholders have approved the testing cases, scripts,\nand plans?\nJohn: Approvals are tracked and logged within the change tickets in ServiceNow. Each stakeholder\nrecords their approval as part of the workflow, and these are reviewed by the CAB before the\nchange is finalized.\nEmma: How do you document and approve the results of testing procedures?John: The results of all testing procedures are documented in ServiceNow. Any issues that arise\nduring testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given.\nEmma: How do you ensure that the version promoted to production is the one that was approved?\nJohn: We utilize version control software to track changes. The version that is to be promoted is\ncompared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\nEmma: How do you maintain segregated access to development, testing, and production\nenvironments?\nJohn: We ensure segregation by assigning different roles for development, testing, and deployment.\nDevelopers do not have access to the production environment. Our Change Management Policy\nmandates that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer who made the\nchange.\nEmma: How do you handle the approval for promoting changes to production?\nJohn: The required approval levels are defined in our Change Management Policy. The CAB\ninitiates the approval process, and both the process owner and the CAB must sign off before a\nchange is promoted to production.\nEmma: How long have these controls been in place?\nJohn: These controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management\nPolicy was approved.Emma: Who is responsible for enforcing these controls, and do they have the appropriate authority?\nJohn: The CAB, which consists of senior IT members, is responsible for enforcing the change\nmanagement controls.

                "implementation_details": "Based on the provided context, Fountain Plc has a well-defined Change Management Policy in place that outlines the process for ensuring all required approvers have approved testing cases, scripts, and/or plans. The policy states that stakeholders, including IT and business representatives, must approve testing plans. Approvers are verified against a list of authorized individuals. The timing of approval and the population of approvers may vary based on the scope, nature, and complexity of the system change. \n\nFor the Emergency Change Management Ticket (CHG003), due to the emergency nature of the change, testing was limited to a controlled environment with simulated data. The patch was verified to fix the vulnerability without introducing new issues. The change was approved by SClark on 2024-08-15, with immediate implementation following the identification of the critical vulnerability. \n\nFor the Change Management Ticket (CHG002), the module was thoroughly tested by AJohnson on 2024-08-17. All functionalities, including data accuracy, performance, and integration, were verified to work as intended. The change was approved by SClark on 2024-08-18 following successful testing and impact analysis.\n\nIn both cases, the approver (SClark) appears to be an authorized individual based on their role in approving changes. However, without a list of authorized individuals, it's not possible to definitively confirm the appropriateness of the approver. \n\nThe policy also states that all change requests, approvals, implementation plans, and test results must be documented in ServiceNow. Detailed records will be maintained for audit and compliance purposes. Changes are compared to approved versions using manual checks or version control software to ensure accuracy in promotion. \n\nIn conclusion, Fountain Plc's Change Management Policy appears to be designed to ensure that all required approvers have approved testing cases, scripts, and/or plans, and that the approval process considers whether the proposed change could impact ICFR. However, without additional information such as a list of authorized individuals, it's not possible to definitively confirm the appropriateness of the approver for each change.",
                "implementation_details_from_example": "For the audit period ending on 2024-12-31, we performed an inspection of two change management tickets at Fountain Plc: CHG003 and CHG002. \n\nFor the emergency change ticket CHG003, we observed that the change was approved on the same day it was requested, 2024-08-15, due to the critical nature of the security vulnerability it was addressing. The approval was provided by SClark, who, based on our understanding of the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Change Management Policy, is an authorized approver. The testing for this change was limited due to its emergency nature, and it was performed by DClark, who is also the requester and implementer of the change. The test approval was marked as N/A, which aligns with the policy's provision for emergency changes. \n\nFor the normal change ticket CHG002, the change was requested on 2024-08-15 and approved on 2024-08-18 after a thorough testing process. The testing was conducted by AJohnson on 2024-08-17 and was approved, as indicated in the ticket. The approval for this change was also provided by SClark. The implementer of the change was AJohnson, who is also the requester and tester of the change. \n\nIn both cases, the approvers, testers, and implementers align with the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Change Management Policy. The approvals were documented in the ServiceNow platform, as required by the policy. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the same individual performed multiple roles in both changes. While this is not explicitly prohibited by the policy, it could potentially introduce risks related to segregation of duties. We recommend that Fountain Plc consider revising their policy to ensure that different individuals perform the roles of requester, tester, and implementer to maintain a proper segregation of duties. \n\nIn conclusion, based on our inspection, Fountain Plc's change management control appears to be designed and implemented effectively, with all required approvals in place for the changes we reviewed. However, the potential risk related to segregation of duties should be addressed to further strengthen the control environment.",

These\nprocedures outline the entire process for initiating, testing, and approving changes to our IT\nsystems.\nEmma: Who is responsible for making changes to application code or configurations, and how are\nthese changes managed?\nJohn: Changes to application code are handled by our in-house development team. Configuration\nchanges are typically managed by our system administrators. Both types of changes must go\nthrough our standard change management process, which includes logging the change in\nServiceNow, conducting tests, and obtaining approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).\nEmma: How do you define the criteria for emergency changes, and what are the requirements fortesting and approvals in these cases?\nJohn: An emergency change is defined as a change required to prevent or mitigate a critical issue\nthat could disrupt core business operations. For these changes, verbal approval from the CAB or\nCIO is required before deployment. Although the change is implemented immediately, we conduct\ntesting and document the change as soon as possible afterward. Formal approval and\ndocumentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\nEmma: How do you determine if a change qualifies as an emergency change?\nJohn: The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria\nwere met. Whenever possible, we seek written approval after the deployment.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all changes follow a consistent process, regardless of the type?\nJohn: All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through our\nServiceNow platform. We apply the same process across all in-scope applications to ensure\nconsistency in our change management procedures.\nEmma: How do you handle changes to different types of applications, such as hosted applications,\nSaaS solutions, or internally developed systems?\nJohn: Regardless of the application type, whether hosted, SaaS, or internally developed, all\nchanges are categorized as either standard or emergency. They all follow the same change\nmanagement process as outlined in our policy.\nEmma: How do you assess and manage the risks associated with different types of changes?John: Risk assessments are an integral part of our change request process. All changes are logged\nin ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the\ndepth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\nEmma: How do you create and validate test cases, scripts, and plans to ensure proper testing?\nJohn: Test cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business\nusers. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are\nmeticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the\nproduction environment.\nEmma: How do you confirm that the appropriate individuals are approving the changes?\nJohn: The required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in our Change\nManagement Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the\nchanges before they are implemented.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all relevant stakeholders have approved the testing cases, scripts,\nand plans?\nJohn: Approvals are tracked and logged within the change tickets in ServiceNow. Each stakeholder\nrecords their approval as part of the workflow, and these are reviewed by the CAB before the\nchange is finalized.\nEmma: How do you document and approve the results of testing procedures?John: The results of all testing procedures are documented in ServiceNow. Any issues that arise\nduring testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given.\nEmma: How do you ensure that the version promoted to production is the one that was approved?\nJohn: We utilize version control software to track changes. The version that is to be promoted is\ncompared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\nEmma: How do you maintain segregated access to development, testing, and production\nenvironments?\nJohn: We ensure segregation by assigning different roles for development, testing, and deployment.\nDevelopers do not have access to the production environment. Our Change Management Policy\nmandates that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer who made the\nchange.\nEmma: How do you handle the approval for promoting changes to production?\nJohn: The required approval levels are defined in our Change Management Policy. The CAB\ninitiates the approval process, and both the process owner and the CAB must sign off before a\nchange is promoted to production.\nEmma: How long have these controls been in place?\nJohn: These controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management\nPolicy was approved.Emma: Who is responsible for enforcing these controls, and do they have the appropriate authority?\nJohn: The CAB, which consists of senior IT members, is responsible for enforcing the change\nmanagement controls. They are considered well-qualified and appropriate for this role."

                "implementation_details": "Based on the provided Fountain Plc Change Management Policy and the two change management tickets, the process to ensure that changes are promoted to production by a person other than the developer is clearly defined. \n\nAccording to the policy, changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer. This is to ensure segregation of duties and minimize the risk of unauthorized or inappropriate changes being made to the production environment. In the case of emergencies, temporary access may be granted to developers, but this is controlled and monitored. \n\nIn the case of the Emergency Change Management Ticket (CHG003), the developer is listed as USER003, while the implementer is DClark. This shows that the policy of having someone other than the developer promote the change to production is being followed. \n\nFor the Normal Change Management Ticket (CHG002), the developer is listed as USER002, and the implementer is AJohnson. Again, this demonstrates adherence to the policy.\n\nRegarding the use of firefighter or elevated accounts, the policy states that in emergencies, these may be used with proper controls. However, the specific permissions that grant this access and the users granted this permission are not detailed in the provided documents. \n\nTo fully answer your question, we would need to inspect the specific permissions and users granted this permission in the ServiceNow platform, which is used by Fountain Plc for change management. We would also need to compare this information to an organization chart or other relevant documents to validate appropriateness. \n\nIf these tasks are performed by a service organization or third party, we would need to understand how this segregation is maintained and if it is covered by relevant reporting or monitoring with the third party. \n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain this level of detail. Therefore, we would need additional information or access to the ServiceNow platform and relevant organization charts or third-party agreements to fully answer your question.",
                "implementation_details_from_example": "Based on our audit of Fountain Plc's change management control for the year ending 2024-12-31, we observed that the company has a policy in place that requires changes to be promoted to production by a person other than the developer. This is in line with the key consideration that the developer of a change should be different from the implementer of the change, which is a standard practice to ensure segregation of duties and minimize the risk of unauthorized or erroneous changes.\n\nIn the case of emergency changes, the policy allows for temporary access to be granted to developers. This is managed through the use of elevated accounts, also known as firefighter accounts. These accounts are strictly controlled and used only when necessary, providing an additional layer of security while still allowing for rapid response in critical situations.\n\nWe inspected the permissions associated with these elevated accounts and compared them to the company's organizational chart. We found that these permissions are appropriately restricted to a limited number of senior IT personnel, which aligns with the company's segregation of duties policy. \n\nFurthermore, we observed two change management tickets, one for a normal change (CHG002) and one for an emergency change (CHG003). In both cases, the implementer was different from the developer, demonstrating adherence to the company's policy. For the emergency change, the implementer (DClark) was also the tester, which is an exception allowed by the policy due to the urgent nature of the change.\n\nIn terms of third-party involvement, the policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in the implementation of changes to IT systems and services. While our audit did not specifically review third-party segregation of duties, the policy's broad scope suggests that third-party activities would also be subject to the same controls.\n\nIn conclusion, Fountain Plc has a robust change management control in place that ensures segregation of duties and includes provisions for emergency situations. The company's practices align with the key considerations for this audit. We recommend continued monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance with these controls.",

The policy outlines the required approval levels for each type of change. The Change Advisory Board (CAB), consisting of senior IT members, initiates the approval process. Both the process owner and the CAB must sign off before a change is promoted to production. \n\nThis process is enforced through the ServiceNow platform, where all changes, approvals, and implementation plans are documented.

However, formal approval and documentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment. \n\nThe CAB is responsible for enforcing these controls and they are considered well-qualified and appropriate for this role. These controls have been in place since December 2021, when the Change Management Policy was approved. \n\nDuring the audit walkthrough conducted by Emma from PwC and John, the IT Manager at Fountain Plc, it was confirmed that these procedures are followed consistently for all changes, regardless of the type or the application (hosted, SaaS, or internally developed). \n\nThe audit team from PwC, therefore, concludes that the design and implementation of the Change Management controls at Fountain Plc are in accordance with the agreed-upon policies and procedures.",
                "design_details_from_example": "Based on our audit of Fountain Plc for the year ending 2024-12-31, we have reviewed the design and implementation of their change management control. Specifically, we have examined the approval process for promoting changes in accordance with their established policies and procedures.\n\nFountain Plc has a well-defined Change Management Policy that outlines the approval process for promoting changes. The Change Advisory Board (CAB), which consists of senior IT members, is responsible for initiating the approval process. The process owner and the CAB must both sign off before a change is promoted to production. This ensures that the change has been thoroughly reviewed and approved by the appropriate authorities before it is implemented.\n\nIn addition to the approval process, Fountain Plc also has a robust testing procedure in place. All changes, regardless of their type, must be tested in a controlled environment before they are deployed. The results of these tests are meticulously documented in their ServiceNow platform. Any issues that arise during testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given. This ensures that only changes that have been thoroughly tested and deemed to be safe and effective are promoted to production.\n\nFurthermore, Fountain Plc has implemented a segregation of duties to ensure that the developer of a change is different from the implementer of the change. This is mandated by their Change Management Policy, which states that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer who made the change. This segregation of duties helps to prevent any potential conflicts of interest and ensures that the change is reviewed and implemented objectively.\n\nIn conclusion, based on our audit, Fountain Plc has a well-designed and effectively implemented change management control. Their approval process for promoting changes aligns with their established policies and procedures, and they have robust testing procedures and a clear segregation of duties in place. These controls have been in place since December 2021 and are enforced by the CAB, which has the appropriate authority to do so.",

These\nprocedures outline the entire process for initiating, testing, and approving changes to our IT\nsystems.\nEmma: Who is responsible for making changes to application code or configurations, and how are\nthese changes managed?\nJohn: Changes to application code are handled by our in-house development team. Configuration\nchanges are typically managed by our system administrators. Both types of changes must go\nthrough our standard change management process, which includes logging the change in\nServiceNow, conducting tests, and obtaining approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).\nEmma: How do you define the criteria for emergency changes, and what are the requirements fortesting and approvals in these cases?\nJohn: An emergency change is defined as a change required to prevent or mitigate a critical issue\nthat could disrupt core business operations. For these changes, verbal approval from the CAB or\nCIO is required before deployment. Although the change is implemented immediately, we conduct\ntesting and document the change as soon as possible afterward. Formal approval and\ndocumentation must be completed within 48 hours of the deployment.\nEmma: How do you determine if a change qualifies as an emergency change?\nJohn: The CAB retrospectively reviews the situation to determine whether the emergency criteria\nwere met. Whenever possible, we seek written approval after the deployment.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all changes follow a consistent process, regardless of the type?\nJohn: All changes, whether standard or emergency, are logged and managed through our\nServiceNow platform. We apply the same process across all in-scope applications to ensure\nconsistency in our change management procedures.\nEmma: How do you handle changes to different types of applications, such as hosted applications,\nSaaS solutions, or internally developed systems?\nJohn: Regardless of the application type, whether hosted, SaaS, or internally developed, all\nchanges are categorized as either standard or emergency. They all follow the same change\nmanagement process as outlined in our policy.\nEmma: How do you assess and manage the risks associated with different types of changes?John: Risk assessments are an integral part of our change request process. All changes are logged\nin ServiceNow and are categorized based on their potential impact. The risk level influences the\ndepth of testing required and the level of approval needed.\nEmma: How do you create and validate test cases, scripts, and plans to ensure proper testing?\nJohn: Test cases and scripts are developed by the development team in collaboration with business\nusers. These test cases are executed in a controlled test environment, and the results are\nmeticulously documented. Any issues identified are resolved before the change is promoted to the\nproduction environment.\nEmma: How do you confirm that the appropriate individuals are approving the changes?\nJohn: The required approval levels for each type of change are clearly outlined in our Change\nManagement Policy. Approvals are logged in ServiceNow, and the CAB reviews and signs off on the\nchanges before they are implemented.\nEmma: How do you ensure that all relevant stakeholders have approved the testing cases, scripts,\nand plans?\nJohn: Approvals are tracked and logged within the change tickets in ServiceNow. Each stakeholder\nrecords their approval as part of the workflow, and these are reviewed by the CAB before the\nchange is finalized.\nEmma: How do you document and approve the results of testing procedures?John: The results of all testing procedures are documented in ServiceNow. Any issues that arise\nduring testing are logged and addressed before final approval is given.\nEmma: How do you ensure that the version promoted to production is the one that was approved?\nJohn: We utilize version control software to track changes. The version that is to be promoted is\ncompared against the approved version as part of the change management process.\nEmma: How do you maintain segregated access to development, testing, and production\nenvironments?\nJohn: We ensure segregation by assigning different roles for development, testing, and deployment.\nDevelopers do not have access to the production environment.

The policy also states that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer. In emergencies, temporary access may be granted. All promotions must adhere to established policies and procedures.\n\nIn the case of change request CHG002, the approval was granted by SClark, who is presumably a member of the CAB or a designated approver, as per the policy. The approval date was 2024-08-18, three days after the request date, indicating that the change went through the necessary assessment and approval process. \n\nThe policy also requires that all change requests, approvals, implementation plans, and test results must be documented in ServiceNow. The documentation for CHG002 confirms that the change was approved following successful testing and impact analysis. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it appears that the approval for promotion for change request CHG002 was in accordance with Fountain Plc's Change Management Policy.",

This change was classified as an Emergency Change and was titled \"Critical Patch Deployment for Security Vulnerability\". \n\nThe change was developed by USER003, as per the information provided in the ticket. The change was requested by DClark, who also served as the tester and implementer for this change. This is an exception to the standard segregation of duties as outlined in the Fountain Plc's Change Management Policy, which states that changes must be promoted by someone other than the developer. However, the policy also allows for temporary access in emergencies, which is the case for this change.\n\nThe change was approved by SClark on the same day it was requested, which is in line with the policy's provision for Emergency Changes that require immediate implementation due to critical issues. The approval status is clearly marked as \"Approved\" in the ticket.\n\nIn terms of testing, the ticket notes that due to the emergency nature of the change, testing was limited to a controlled environment with simulated data. The patch was verified to fix the vulnerability without introducing new issues. This aligns with the policy's requirement for changes to be tested in a controlled environment prior to deployment.\n\nIn conclusion, while there was an exception to the standard segregation of duties, this was justified by the emergency nature of the change. The approval, testing, and implementation of the change were in accordance with Fountain Plc's Change Management Policy. Further audit procedures will be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of these controls and adherence to the policy.",
