Change Request and Approval,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to perform testing, review and authorization of changes and/or emergency changes.",Inspected a copy of 'change enablement policy' and 'change management standard operating procedures' approved by the CIO on xx/xx/2022,"Policies should be updated in the current year. If not, flag an exception"
,"How and who is responsible for making changes to application code (e.g. versions) configuration (e.g., settings or tolerances that can be made via the application without requiring amendments to code) and whether such changes are subject to the same change control processes.","Both applications have been developed by third party vendors. As such version changes are made by the third party development companies and version upgrades are released every 6 months by the vendors, with patches released occasionally. Management run both applications 2 versions behing. These changes are logged by management and tested and approved prior to release following the standard change process. 

Configuration changes are made by the application owner in IT based on a request from the business. These follow the same standard change process. 

The CAB is required to approve changes and typically UAT is performed by the requestor for the change or their delegate",
,"How emergency change criteria has been defined and requirements around the timing of required testing and promotion approvals (e.g., within 48 hours of a change being promoted into production).","The 'Change enablement policy' and ' change management standard operating procedures' set out criteria for an emergency change. A change is considered an emergency if it is proposed to address an issue with system functionalyt which would otherwise prevent the operation of a core business process. Verbal approval must be sought from CAB or the CIO prior to deployment testing and approval of these changes is still required, with the policy dictating that all change documentation should be in place within 72 hours of the change being implemented in production. This includes testing, approval from process owners and retrospective approval from the CAB (which includes the CIO) via email. ",Emergency changes are expected to be tested and approved. If this is not done flag an exception
Test Management,"How the control operator determines the appropriate level of testing required (e.g., unit, integration, regression and user acceptance testing) was performed. The nature and extent of testing may vary based on the scope and complexity of the change.","The level of testing required is based on the nature of the change, the specific code/configuration subject to change and expected functionality. There is also consideration of any dependencies and wider implications of the change.

Based on this, an itemised test plan is developed. ",
,"How the control operator creates test cases, scripts and plans to achieve an appropriate level of testing.","Test cases are created with business users asked to utilise the functionality in the test environment with specific procedures recorded based on input from the development team and process owner. 

The test logs the results of each test and any issues noted in the test scripts are recorded for resolution. ",
,"How the control operator confirms the appropriateness of the approvers (e.g., through comparing the approval to a listing of authorized individuals, if available or through evaluation of roles & responsibilities).","The level of approval requirement needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy. 

- Approval to initiate the development process is provided by the change advisory board. 
- All changes require approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign off from the change advisory board. ",
Segregation of duties,"The process in place to ensure that changes are promoted to production by a person other than the developer, or if applicable, access control mechanisms in place (e.g., use of firefighter/elevated accounts) to allow developers temporary access to production in the event of an emergency.","With a small application support team, it is not possbible to fully segregate access to development, test and production. The development engineerrs do not have access to admin accounts in the production application environment. 

The change enablement policy sets out protocols to be applied ensuring that the individual responsible from development is different from the people responsible for testing the change, approving and implementing in production. ",
,The approval for promotion in accordance with agreed upon policies and/or procedures.,"The level of approval requirement needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy. 

 - Approval to initiate the development process is provided by the change advisory board
- All changes require approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign offf from the change advisorry board.",
Inspection of a sample Change,Inspect the relevant policy and procedure documents and document the name and version inspected,Inspected a copy of 'change enablement policy' and 'change management standard operating procedures' approved by the CIO on xx/xx/2022. The version inspected was v3,"Policies should be updated in the current year. If not, flag an exception"
,"Inspect system configuration and/or user access to determine management has appropriately segregated access to development, test and production or has other controls in place to achieve the same objective",Confirmed through validating applications are third pary development and procedures performed over privilegd access to confirm accounts that can make changes to settings,The developer of a change should be different from the implementer of the change
,For one emergency change inspect the criteria in the policy and compare to an emergency change logged in the period to understand how the criteria are defined and met,"We inspected a copy of change ticket XYZ456 for an emergenct change raised by the financial controller. 

It was confirmed that the change met the criteria of an emergency changes with issues of reporting functionality. This was confirmed by the application manager with verbal approval soughr from the CIO. 

Withing the change ticker, the junior developer (Jogn Doe) was assigned to develop the change which was implemented by the application manager on xx/xx/2022. 

After the change was implemented, testing was retrospectively completed to confirm that there was no issues with functionality with results documented and attacked to the change ticket. 

Approval was retrospectively provided by the process owner on xx/xx/2022. In addition, the CAB convened to review change documentation and approved this emergency change on xx/xx/2022, 48 hours after implementation. This is logged in the attached change ticket. ",Emergency changes are expected to be tested and approved. If this is not done flag an exception
,Inspect evidence that change process is homogenous by application. Validate the process for different risk categories,Observed that when creating a new change request there is only standard and emergency as a drop down in the 'Type of change' field.,
,"For one change, inspect the evidence retained for testing. Was the testing performed before the change was implemented","For the change sampled under ticket ABC123, we confirmed through inspection the following

- Approval to develop the change provided by the CAB on 30th June. 
- UAT completed and approved by the AR manager on 13 July. 
- Approval of testing and signoff deploy the change from the process owner on 15th July. 
- Final approval to deploy the change provided by the CAB on 16th July. 
- Change implemented in production enviroment on 17th July. ","Changes are to be tested before implementation. If this is not done, raise this as an exception"
,"For one change, inspect the existence of testing performed","For the change sampled under ticket ABC123, we confirmed through inspection the following

- Approval to develop the change provided by the CAB on 30th June. 
- UAT completed and approved by the AR manager on 13 July. 
- Approval of testing and signoff deploy the change from the process owner on 15th July. 
- Final approval to deploy the change provided by the CAB on 16th July. 
- Change implemented in production enviroment on 17th July. ","Test evidence are expected to be maintained in a change ticket. If this is not done, raise a ticket"
,"For one same change chosen, inspect evidence to verify that the sample change was approved","For the change sampled under ticket ABC123, we confirmed that version control was documented in the change ticket, with detail of the latest version suject to testing","Changes are to be approved before they are deployed. IF this is not done, raise an exception"
