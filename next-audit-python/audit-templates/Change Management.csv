Change Request and Approval,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to perform testing, review and authorization of changes and/or emergency changes.",Pass,"Inspected the entity's 'Change enablement policy' and 'Change management standard operating procedures', approved by the CIO on XX/XX/2022"
,"How and who is responsible for making changes to application code (e.g. versions) configuration (e.g., settings or tolerances that can be made via the application without requiring amendments to code) and whether such changes are subject to the same change control processes.",Pass,"Both applications have been developed by third party vendors. As such version changes are made by the third party development companies and version upgrades are released every 6 months by the vendors, with patches released occasionally. Configuration changes are made by the application owner in IT based on a request from the business. These follow the same standard change process. Management runs both applications 2 versions behind. These changes are logged by management and tested and approved prior to release following the standard change process. The CAB is required to approve changes and typically UAT is performed by the requester for the change or their delegate."
,"How emergency change criteria has been defined and requirements around the timing of required testing and promotion approvals (e.g., within 48 hours of a change being promoted into production).",Pass,"The 'Change enablement policy' and 'Change management standard operating procedures' set out criteria for an emergency change. A change is considered an emergency if it is proposed to address an issue with system functionality which would otherwise prevent the operation of a core business process. Verbal approval must be sought from the CAB or the CIO prior to deployment. Testing and approval of these changes is still required, with the policy dictating that all change documentation should be in place within 72 hours of the change being implemented in production - This includes testing, approval from process owners and retrospective approval from the CAB (which includes the CIO) via email. The CAB is required to retrospectively determine that the criteria was met within 72 hours and approval is sought prior to deployment. Where possible written approval is sought prior to deployment depending on availability and urgency."
,"How the control operator determines if a change meets the emergency change criteria (e.g., tracing back to an emergency change request, etc.).",Pass,"The CAB is required to retrospectively determine that the criteria was met. Where possible, written approval is sought prior to deployment."
,Assess the homogeneity of the change process?,Pass,Refer to homogeneity assessment tab for full detail.
,a) how does the control operator differentiate between changes to in-scope applications?,Pass,All changes which impact system functionality and outputs are subject to testing as set out in the change enablement policy. There are no separate processes for different applications.
,"For example changes to hosted applications, SaaS or in-house developed.",Pass,Within the servicedesk application there are different types of changes assigned. In practice all changes are standard or emergency. There are no other categories. All changes are subject to the same process.
,b) how does the control operator differentiate between different risks related to change?,Pass,All changes are captured in the same servicedesk tool and follow the standard process.
,For example pre-approved / standard / major / emergency,Pass,All configuration changes to in-scope applications follow the standard or emergency process. An emergency process is extremely rare for third party developed applications although if there was a specific cyber risk that required an emergency patch this may follow the emergency process.
,c) how does the control operator differentiate between different types of change?,Pass,All code changes to in-scope applications follow the standard or emergency process. An emergency process is extremely rare for third party developed applications although if there was a specific cyber risk that required an emergency patch this may follow the emergency process.
,- Change to configurations / functionality in the application layer,Pass,All configuration changes to in-scope applications follow the standard or emergency process.
,- Change to code or software versions (including updates provided by third party developers),Pass,All code changes to in-scope applications follow the standard or emergency process. An emergency process is extremely rare for third party developed applications although if there was a specific cyber risk that required an emergency patch this may follow the emergency process.
,- Changes to job schedules / batch processes and the associated scheduling software,Pass,All changes to job schedules are subject to testing and approval as set out in the change enablement policy.
,- Changes to databases / data tables including the data fix process,Pass,Database fixes are not covered by the change process but instead fall under the incident process whereby data fix requests are raised by business users to the servicedesk. These require sign off from the application owner before they are actioned.
Test Management,"How the control operator determines the appropriate level of testing required (e.g., unit, integration, regression and user acceptance testing) was performed. The nature and extent of testing may vary based on the scope and complexity of the change.",Pass,"The level of testing required is based on the nature of the change, the specific code/configuration subject to change and the expected functionality. There is also consideration of any dependencies and wider implications of the change. Based on this, an itemised test plan is developed."
,"How the control operator creates test cases, scripts and plans to achieve an appropriate level of testing.",Pass,"The test logs are created with business users asked to utilise the functionality in the test environment, with specific procedures recorded based on input from the development team and process owner. The results of each test and any issues noted in the test script are recorded for resolution."
,"How the control operator confirms the appropriateness of the approvers (e.g., through comparing the approval to a listing of authorized individuals, if available or through evaluation of roles & responsibilities).",Pass,"The level of approval needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy. Approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign off from the change advisory board, is required before the development process is provided by the change advisory board. All changes require approval."
,"The process in place to ensure that all relevant stakeholders (e.g., representatives of IT and the business) have approved testing cases, scripts and/or plans. The timing of approval and the population of approvers may vary based on the scope, nature and complexity of the system change. The approval process should consider whether the proposed change could impact ICFR and be subjected to appropriate approval where applicable.",Pass,"Approvals are logged within change tickets, with individuals logging their approval and activities through a workflow. Change tickets and the approvals are subject to review as part of the approval from the CAB to deploy a change. This acts as a final approval which is also logged in the ticket."
,How the control operator documents and approves the results of testing procedures performed.,Pass,"Test cases are created with business users asked to utilise the functionality in the test environment, with specific procedures recorded based on input from the development team and process owner. The test logs the results of each test and any issues noted in the test script are recorded for resolution. If any remedial work is required, testing is re-performed until it can be completed with no issues."
,"How the control operator compares the version to be promoted to that approved for promotion (e.g., manual comparison or through version control software) and verifies it is promoted to production accurately.",Pass,"Version control protocols are set out in the change enablement policy, with detail of the version to be implemented in production logged within the change ticket."
,"The process in place to ensure that management has appropriately segregated access to development, test and production or has other controls in place to achieve the same objective.",Pass,"Given the limited application support team, it is not possible to fully segregate access to development, test and production. The change enablement policy sets out protocols to be applied ensuring that the individual responsible for development is different from the people responsible for testing the change, approving and implementing in production."
,How the control operator follows up on differences or exceptions noted during the testing or processing of changes for promotion or agrees with appropriate stakeholders that exception(s) is not critical.,Pass,"Test cases are created with business users asked to utilise the functionality in the test environment, with specific procedures recorded based on input from the development team and process owner. The test logs the results of each test and any issues noted in the test script are recorded for resolution. If any remedial work is required, testing is re-performed until it can be completed with no issues."
,ow the control operator follows up on differences or exceptions noted during the testing or processing of changes for promotion or agrees with appropriate stakeholders that exception(s) is not critical.,Pass,"Test cases are created with business users asked to utilize the functionality in the test environment, with specific procedures recorded based on input from the development team and process owner. The tester logs the results of each test and any issues noted in the test script are recorded for resolution. If any remedial work is required, testing is re-performed until it can be completed with no issues."
Segregation of duties,"The process in place to ensure that changes are promoted to production by a person other than the developer, or if applicable, access control mechanisms in place (e.g., use of firefighter/elevated accounts) to allow developers temporary access to production in the event of an emergency.",Pass,"With a small application support team, it is not possible to fully segregate access to development, test and production. The development engineers do not have access to admin accounts in the production application environment. The change enablement policy sets out protocols to be applied ensuring that the individual responsible for development is different from the people responsible for testing the change, approving and implementing in production."
,The approval for promotion in accordance with agreed upon policies and/or procedures.,Pass,"The level of approval requirement needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy: - The level to initiate the development process is provided by the change advisory board. - All changes require approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign off from the change advisory board."
,The period for which the control has been in operation and the frequency of its operation.,Pass,The control has been in place for the full period subject to audit.
,The appropriateness of the person(s) performing the control(s).,Pass,The CAB is made up of senior members of the IT function and considered appropriate to enforce change processes.
