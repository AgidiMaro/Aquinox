Domain,Testing Criteria,Test Results,Findings and Observations
Change Request and Approval,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to perform testing, review and authorization of changes and/or emergency changes.",Pass,"Inspected the entity's 'Change enablement policy' and 'Change management standard operating procedures', approved by the CIO on XX/XX/2022"
,"How and who is responsible for making changes to application code (e.g. versions) configuration (e.g., settings or tolerances that can be made via the application without requiring amendments to code) and whether such changes are subject to the same change control processes.",Pass,"Both applications have been developed by third party vendors. As such version changes are made by the third party development companies and version upgrades are released every 6 months by the vendors, with patches released occasionally. Configuration changes are made by the application owner in IT based on a request from the business. These follow the same standard change process. Management runs both applications 2 versions behind. These changes are logged by management and tested and approved prior to release following the standard change process. The CAB is required to approve changes and typically UAT is performed by the requester for the change or their delegate."
,"How emergency change criteria has been defined and requirements around the timing of required testing and promotion approvals (e.g., within 48 hours of a change being promoted into production).",Pass,"The 'Change enablement policy' and 'Change management standard operating procedures' set out criteria for an emergency change. A change is considered an emergency if it is proposed to address an issue with system functionality which would otherwise prevent the operation of a core business process. Verbal approval must be sought from the CAB or the CIO prior to deployment. Testing and approval of these changes is still required, with the policy dictating that all change documentation should be in place within 72 hours of the change being implemented in production - This includes testing, approval from process owners and retrospective approval from the CAB (which includes the CIO) via email. The CAB is required to retrospectively determine that the criteria was met within 72 hours and approval is sought prior to deployment. Where possible written approval is sought prior to deployment depending on availability and urgency."
Test Management,"How the control operator determines the appropriate level of testing required (e.g., unit, integration, regression and user acceptance testing) was performed. The nature and extent of testing may vary based on the scope and complexity of the change.",Pass,"The level of testing required is based on the nature of the change, the specific code/configuration subject to change and the expected functionality. There is also consideration of any dependencies and wider implications of the change. Based on this, an itemised test plan is developed."
,"How the control operator creates test cases, scripts and plans to achieve an appropriate level of testing.",Pass,"The test logs are created with business users asked to utilise the functionality in the test environment, with specific procedures recorded based on input from the development team and process owner. The results of each test and any issues noted in the test script are recorded for resolution."
,"How the control operator confirms the appropriateness of the approvers (e.g., through comparing the approval to a listing of authorized individuals, if available or through evaluation of roles & responsibilities).",Pass,"The level of approval needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy. Approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign off from the change advisory board, is required before the development process is provided by the change advisory board. All changes require approval."
Segregation of duties,"The process in place to ensure that changes are promoted to production by a person other than the developer, or if applicable, access control mechanisms in place (e.g., use of firefighter/elevated accounts) to allow developers temporary access to production in the event of an emergency.",Pass,"With a small application support team, it is not possible to fully segregate access to development, test and production. The development engineers do not have access to admin accounts in the production application environment. The change enablement policy sets out protocols to be applied ensuring that the individual responsible for development is different from the people responsible for testing the change, approving and implementing in production."
,The approval for promotion in accordance with agreed upon policies and/or procedures.,Pass,"The level of approval requirement needed for each type of change is set out in the change enablement policy: - The level to initiate the development process is provided by the change advisory board. - All changes require approval from the process owner in the business, along with sign off from the change advisory board."
Inspection of a sample Change,Inspect the relevant policy and procedure documents and document the name and version inspected,,
,"Inspect system configuration and/or user access to determine management has appropriately segregated access to development, test and production or has other controls in place to achieve the same objective",,
,For one emergency change inspect the criteria in the policy and compare to an emergency change logged in the period to understand how the criteria are defined and met,,
,Inspect evidence that change process is homogenous by application. Validate the process for different risk categories,,
,"For one change, inspect the evidence retained for testinng. Was the testing performed before the change was implemented",,
,"For one change, inspect the existence of testing performed",,
,"For one same chanfe chosen, inspect evidence to verify that the sample change was approved",,
