Batch Job Management,"Information (e.g., policies and/or procedures) that is utilized to identify and resolve errors:",Fail,There is no specific policy or procedure document that sets out the process.
,"How the system executes the action of the control (identifies processing errors), specifically considering: - Data fields used to identify, log, and process errors. - Programmed system logic to flag, log, and/or alert personnel of errors as expected in the control design (if designed). - Thresholds and severity classification for processing errors. - Frequency of error processing alerts and review of errors (i.e., daily, ad-hoc, etc.). - Whether the system functionality operated in an unexpected manner during the period; and if so, how did management resolve the issues and assess the results for possible impact on the operating effectiveness of the control.",Pass,"On a daily basis, revenue transactions are transferred from Revenue application to the General Ledger application. This is scheduled to take place at 5 pm each day when production for the day is complete. The organisation uses the application ""JobScheduler"" which automates the daily interface. This is monitored by the application support team who are responsible for operating the daily control where successful completion of the job is confirmed. The threshold for the job is success or failure. There are no other thresholds applied. In the event of an error with connections or the transmission of data, the job will attempt to run again every 15 minutes. After five attempts, the job will display as ""cancelled."" There are two main categories - Connection errors or processing errors (where data is not completely and accurately transferred from one system to another)."
,How the control operator confirms/validates that an actual error has occurred,Pass,"The job status report run by the application manager, the status of each job is recorded as either: - Complete (Ran with no issues noted) - Cancelled (Ran but encountered an error) - Scheduled (Due to run) Where issues occur with either connections or the transmission of data, the job is listed as ""cancelled"" within the status report run by management each day."
,"How the control operator investigates and resolves the processing errors (or differences) identified by the system in a timely manner through a standard process, for example: - Correcting one or more transactions and submitting them into the system for reprocessing. - Initiating a system change request to correct the processing error. - Detailing the exception and submitting into the system for reprocessing based on an agreed exception policies and procedures.",Pass,"When a job is listed as ""cancelled"" the application manager is responsible for raising a ticket on the service desk system. The application support team investigates the root cause of the error and ensures that the job is successfully run the next day. If a change is required to address the issue, this will be implemented through the change management process (refer to 'change testing and approval' tab). The control operator follows up on status of the ticket and any remedial actions required."
,How the control operator confirms that investigation and resolution was adequately performed in a timely manner.,Pass,The control operator follows up on a daily basis and any remedial actions are resolved as a category one issue through the incident management process. Target time for resolution of category one issues is 8 hours.
,The period for which the control has been in operation and the frequency of its operation.,Pass,The control has been in place for the full period subject to audit. The transfer of data occurs daily and this control is operated each day on the following morning.
,The appropriateness of the person(s) performing the control(s).,Pass,"As the application manager, we have confirmed John Smith is appropriately positioned to function as control owner based on his job role and technical knowledge of the applications."
Backup and disaster recovery,Policies and/or procedures related to the entities backup and recovery process(es).,Pass,"A policy document is in place setting out backup protocols for each application used in the business. The backup protocols are set out in a tiered approach, with tier one (priority) applications subject to more frequent, comprehensive backups and tier three applications backed up less frequently."
,"Whether third parties are used to perform services related to backup and recovery (e.g., cloud providers).",Pass,No third parties are used to perform services related to backup and recovery - this is all managed in-house.
,How the control operator determines when types of data are included and the frequency in the backup cycle.,Pass,"A policy document is in place setting out backup protocols for each application used in the business. The backup protocols are set out in a tiered approach, with tier one (priority) applications subject to more frequent, comprehensive backups and tier three applications backed up less frequently."
,Any changes to the backup configuration(s) and/or schedule(s) are managed through the change control process.,Pass,Changes to backup configuration or schedules are managed through the change management process - Refer to 'change testing and approval' tab for details.
,How the control operator confirms backups for successful completion.,Pass,Completion of backups is displayed on a dashboard which management uses to monitor successful completion. This is checked daily with issues followed up by the IT manager.
,How the control operator resolves errors encountered during the backup process(es).,Pass,Issues encountered through the backup processes are addressed through the incident management process. Typically the IT manager will wait until the following day to see if the backup runs successfully. If the backup fails two consecutive days then the IT manager will attempt to run the backup manually. This is very rare.
,"How the control operator ensures that backup media would be available in the event of an emergency (e.g., off-site rotation of media, replication of data to hosted site, cloud, etc.).",Pass,Data is replicated in an off-premise location to ensure that data is available in the event that the on-premise location is not available.
,"Whether data is stored on premise, off premise, third-party cloud, etc.",Pass,"Data is stored in two separate sites, one on premise and one site 10 miles from the main office location."
,"Has management established a recovery time objective (RTO) (i.e., amount of time allotted for the recovery of a business function or resource after an incident occurs) for financially significant applications and related infrastructure.",Pass,"RTOs have been established for each system, with a tiered approach prioritizing ERP systems and critical business applications."
,"Has management established a recovery point objective (RPO) (i.e., amount of time the data can be lost before a material impact to financial reporting occurs) for financially significant applications and related infrastructure.",Pass,"RPOs have been established for each system, with a tiered approach prioritizing ERP systems and critical business applications."
,"How the system has been configured to back up financially significant data on a scheduled (e.g., partial, incremental, full backups) or real-time basis.",Pass,Incremental backups are taken on a daily basis for tier one applications (key financial systems) with a full backup taken on a weekly basis.
,"How the control operator periodically tests backups for recoverability against the entity's defined RTO and RPO (e.g., scheduled testing, throughout the period when recovering from processing problems, etc.).",Pass,"On a monthly basis, a sample of applications is selected by the service desk team and a ticket assigned to the IT manager with their selection. The IT manager is responsible for testing ability to recover the selected systems from backup."
,How the control operator records and/or evidences the performance of backups and recovery testing.,Pass,Evidence of successful completion is recorded within the ticket along with any issues noted. Screenshots are retained as evidence attached to the ticket along with the detail of any remedial work needed.
,How the control operator follows up on exceptions noted during testing of backup and recoverability.,Pass,This follows the standard incident process with an incident ticket raised.
,The period for which the control has been in operation and the frequency of its operation.,Pass,The control has been in place for the full period subject to audit. Backups take place daily and testing of ability to recover from backups is performed monthly.
,The appropriateness of the person(s) performing the control(s).,Pass,"As the IT manager, we have confirmed Joe Bloggs is appropriately positioned to function as control owner based on his job role and technical knowledge."
